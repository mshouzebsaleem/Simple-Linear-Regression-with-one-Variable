# Simple-Linear-Regression-with-one-Variable

A simple python program that implements Linear Regression on a sample dataset. The program uses sklearn.linear_model from the scikit-learn library to import the class LinearRegression.

A graph is plotted using the matplotlib.pyplot to visually represent the Linear Regression model.
